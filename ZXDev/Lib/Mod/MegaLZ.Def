    Z80 depacker FOR megalz V4 packed files   (C) fyrex^mhm

    DESCRIPTION:

    Depacker is fully relocatable, NOT self-modifying,
    it's length is 110 bytes starting from DEC40.
    Register usage: AF,AF',BC,DE,HL. Must be CALL'ed, return is done by RET.
    Provide extra stack location FOR store 2 bytes (1 word). Depacker does NOT
    disable OR enable interrupts, AS well AS could be interrupted AT any time
    (no f*cking wicked stack usage :).

     USAGE:

     - put depacker anywhere you want,
     - put starting address of packed block in HL,
     - put location where you want data TO be depacked in DE,
       (much like LDIR command, but without BC)
     - make CALL TO depacker (DEC40).
     - enjoy! ;)

     PRECAUTIONS:

     Be very careful IF packed AND depacked blocks coincide somewhere in memory.
     Here are some advices:

     1. put packed block TO the highest addresses possible.
         Best IF last BYTE of packed block has address #FFFF.

     2. Leave some gap between ends of packed AND depacked block.
         FOR example, last BYTE of depacked block AT #FF00,
         last BYTE of packed block AT #FFFF.

     3. Place nonpackable data TO the END of block.

     4. Always check whether depacking occurs OK AND neither corrupts
         depacked data nor hangs computer.
