1. Disclaimer
-------------

I'm not liable for any damage caused by the use of this program.


2. Installation
---------------

Program is distributed in source code. For installation you need C compiler to
compile binary execution file. If you are useing gcc compiler you can compile
program by
  $ gcc bin2tap.c -o bin2tap
This will produce execution file. For other compilers read their documentation.

Than, copy execution file into directory, where your operating system search for
execution files. For example:
  $ cp bin2tap /usr/bin/


3. Using
--------

Program convert input file into CODE block in .tap file. Program can create
simple BASIC loader too. Program syntax is as follow:

  bin2tap [options] input_file

All options are optional except input file name. If some option is requied and
not set, it's used default value. Options are:

  -a address             start address of CODE block, default value is 32768
  -o output_file         assign output .tap file. If this switch is not set,
                         program try to replace extension of input file
                         (extension is search in last 4 characters) by .tap
                         extension. If he's not successfull, join extension
                         after name of input file.

  -b                     this switch include BASIC loader in output file
  -c clear_address       set address in CLEAR command in loader, default value
                         is 24575
  -r run_address         set run address in loader (RANDOMIZE USR), defaul value
                         is 32768
  -cb value              set BORDER colour to value, default value is 0
  -cp value              set PAPER colour to value, default value is 0
  -ci value              set INK colour to value, default value is 7
  -d80                   create D80 loader, name of BASIC loader is set to "run"
  -append                append created tap at end of file
  -hp | --header-poke    include POKE 23739,111 command for dissabling tape headers

  -h  | --help           print usage information
  -v  | --version        print program version

BASIC loader looks as follow:
10 REM loader by bin2tap1.3
20 BORDER VAL "0": PAPER VAL "0": INK VAL "7"
30 CLEAR VAL "24575"
40 POKE VAL "23739", CODE "o"
50 LOAD  "name_of_file" CODE
60 RANDOMIZE USR VAL "32768"


4. Format of .tap file
----------------------

The .tap files contain blocks of tape-saved data. All blocks start with two
bytes specifying how many bytes will follow (not counting the two length bytes).
Then raw tape data follows, including the flag and checksum bytes. The checksum
is the bitwise XOR of all bytes including the flag byte. For example, when you
execute the line SAVE "ROM" CODE 0,2 this will result:

|------ Spectrum-generated data -------|                |------|
13 00 00 03 52 4f 4d 7x20 02 00 00 00 00 80 f1 04 00 ff f3 af a3

^^^^^...... first block is 19 bytes (17 bytes+flag+checksum)
      ^^... flag byte (A reg, 00 for headers, ff for data blocks)
         ^^ first byte of header, indicating a code block

file name ..^^^^^^^^^^^^^
header info ..............^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
checksum of header .........................^^
length of second block ........................^^^^^
flag byte ...........................................^^
first two bytes of rom .................................^^^^^
checksum .....................................................^^

Note that it is possible to join .tap files by simply stringing them together,
for example COPY /B FILE1.TAP + FILE2.TAP ALL.TAP

Here is the structure of a tape header, which always consists of 17 bytes:

Byte    Length  Description
---------------------------
0       1       Type (0,1,2 or 3)
1       10      Filename (padded with blanks)
11      2       Length of data block
13      2       Parameter 1
15      2       Parameter 2

The type is 0,1,2 or 3 for a PROGRAM, Number array, Character array or CODE
file. A SCREEN$ file is regarded as a CODE file with start address 16384 and
length 6912 decimal. If the file is a PROGRAM file, parameter 1 holds the
autostart line number (or a number >=32768 if no LINE parameter was given) and
parameter 2 holds the start of the variable area relative to the start of the
program. If it's a CODE file, parameter 1 holds the start of the code block when
saved, and parameter 2 holds 32768. For data files finally, the byte at position
14 decimal holds the variable name.
